# OOPAssiments_AandA
First project in OOP course at Ariel University,Israel.
This project is a smart elevator algorithm. This algorithm is locating the best elevator for each call, so the total waiting time should be small.
We have the main class - ElevatorAlgoClass, which implements the ElevatorAlgo Interface.
